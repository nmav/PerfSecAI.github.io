            <h2>Protect your infrastructure from malware threats</h2>
            <p>The Python Package Index (PyPI), is a vital repository for myriad Python software projects. Due to its popularity it has been weaponized by malicious actors deploying malware through typosquatting—subtly misspelling package names to trap unwary developers into incorporating hazardous code. This tactic can devastate your organizational security exposing the organization to unprecedented risk.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Harden the security of your development teams, ensuring that only expert-vetted and digitally signed packages are interwoven into your codebase. We prioritize your software’s sanctity by granting your teams access solely to software meticulously shielded from known malware, protecting your organization’s data and operations.</p>

            <h2>Comply with cybersecurity regulations</h2>
            <p>The recently instituted EU Cyber Resilience Act and the redefined US cybersecurity strategy have sculpted a new paradigm, placing product vendors under scrutinizing focus and holding them accountable for cybersecurity incidents. Software vendors, particularly those navigating the critical product landscape, are mandated to uphold rigorous secure processes, ensuring the software remains free of known vulnerabilities and exercising due diligence in integrating third-party software.</p>
          </div>
          <p>With perfsec you maintain unwavering compliance with stringent international cybersecurity regulations and established security benchmarks.

            <h2>Automate SBOM Generation</h2>
            <p>Providing a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has become a non-negotiable standard in software delivery, offering a transparent lens through which end users can identify and navigate potential vulnerabilities, especially during critical cybersecurity crises like the notorious log4j incident. The SBOM not only signifies a commitment to transparency but also fortifies your user's trust, allowing them to identify and mitigate vulnerable components swiftly and effectively during pressing situations, thereby safeguarding their operations and maintaining the integrity of their digital assets.</p>
          </div>
          <p>With our Wyse Companion Tool, you effortlessly generate SBOMs and proactively manage vulnerabilities within your software dependencies. Navigate through the complex terrains of software delivery with a guardian that not only automates boring time-consuming tasks, but identifies vulnerable software early prior to shipping to customers.</p>
